# pomoday-api

Webservice for [huytd/pomoday-v2](https://github.com/huytd/pomoday-v2)

It probably has not the best security, but des its job saving data from __Pomoday__.

### Installation

- put this repo on your webserver
- have the url point to `/api` in order to hide the `data` folder

## ToDos

- this was just a quick and dirty solution. I may refine this in the future
